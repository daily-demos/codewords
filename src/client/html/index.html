            Play directly in your browser with video chat. No need to install
            any other software. Just click the “Create game” button above. It
            will create a room and a link that you can share with people you
            want to play with. Invite your friends, family, students or
            coworkers!

          <h2>Quick start</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The Spymaster gives verbal one-word hint and a number to their
              team. The word is the hint players use to associate with their
              team’s target words. The number indicates the number of words the
              hint ties together.
            </li>
            <li>
              Players try to guess the Spymaster's hinted words, while avoiding
              the words of the other team.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once Players have guessed the number of words given by their
              Spymaster, Players can click "End Turn", so the other team can
              guess their words.
            </li>
            <li>The first team with no words left to guess wins</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>About this site</h2>
          <p>
            This site was created by Daily to showcase the custom video chat
            capabilities of our WebRTC APIs. We were inspired by the board game,
            Codenames&trade; and have used the game play mechanics to create a
            free playable online version. Codenames&trade; is a popular game to
            play on Zoom with coworkers, but since we work with developing video
            conferencing APIs, we thought a social game would be a perfect
            candidtate to embed our video call capabilities into it.
          </p>
          <h2>Are you a software developer?</h2>
          <p>
            If you are a developer and would like to see our source code, check
            out our Github. Feel free to use it as a starting point to develop
            your own social gaming app with video chat. You can also read the
            detailed writeup on our blog where we explain our code and the
            frameworks we used. You’ll want to first sign up and grab an API
            key.

            We at Daily have created this demo to show how easy it is to add
            video chat capabilities to any application. We have video SDKs for
            Android, iOS, JavaScript, React Native, and more. We have a lot more
            WebRTC demos to give you an idea of what is possible with fully
            customizable and embedable real-time video.
          </p>
